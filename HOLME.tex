\begin{abstract}
Our team is strivingly working on developing a MATTER-based smart home configuration maintenance application called `HOLME.' The aim of this application is to make it convenient to bring the existing smart home configuration to locations other than one's own home.
Traditional smart home configuration have been constrained to specific applications under the umbrella of a single manufacturer. However, with the emergence of the MATTER protocol, it has become possible to integrate various IoT devices of different manufacturers seamlessly. Based on the MATTER protocol, we try to utilize the protocol to upload and download one's smart home settings to the server in any circumstances.
Our core objectives revolve around the following two points: (1) Convenience: We aim to enable users to utilize our app to easily import their well-configured and time-consuming smart home settings  to different places via QR code at once.
(2) Replaceability: When users go to a new place which do not have device(s) in their homes, we aim to align the environment to the pre-configured environment. We provide notifications and reports after the replacement process.
Through a B2B business model, our application allows users to conveniently migrate their smart home environments using QR codes, not only from one home to another but also to places like hotels.
Through this project, we aspire to expand the scope of traditional smart homes and develop a service that will play a pivotal role in the emerging sharing economy, particularly in shared housing scenarios in the near future.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

\subsection{Motivation}
In 2003, when the global population was 6.3 billion, there were 500 million IoT devices. However, it is anticipated that by 2025, there will be a distribution of 1 trillion IoT devices among a global population of 8.1 billion. As the proliferation of IoT devices has rapidly progressed, ICT companies have individually developed their IoT platforms. However, an issue arose as each company created their own applications.

The existing smart home environment relied on devices from specific manufacturers and their proprietary applications. This resulted in users being tied to specific brands or apps when setting up their smart home environments. For example, a user with Samsung smart home devices who wanted to add LG smart home devices had to reset their existing Samsung smart home environment and download the LG smart home app, which was quite inconvenient for users.

MATTER was created with the aim of unifying these 'fragmented' IoT platforms, making it possible to control IoT devices from various manufacturers using a single protocol.

With the introduction of the new MATTER protocol, it has become possible to effectively integrate various IoT devices. Therefore, we intend to develop an application that leverages cloud servers and generative AI to enable users to easily retrieve the smart home environment they configured at home from different locations.

Our team's goal is to provide a feature that allows users to set up their initial smart home environment just once. This environment should remain easily maintainable when they travel, move, or go on business trips to different locations. This application is not only applicable to individual users but also to B2B scenarios, such as hotels and other accommodation providers. Furthermore, it is anticipated that it will play a pivotal role in shared economy models, like shared housing, in the future.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
\begin{itemize}
\item [1] In the modern world, where the penetration rate of IoT (Internet of Things) devices is steadily increasing, the need for services that manage these devices and operate the environment efficiently is becoming more important. \\
\item [2] As the percentage of international travel and business trips has increased since the end of COVID-19 and this has resulted in many people moving to other places, the need for services that can easily relocate and set up the environment of smart home devices is becoming more pronounced.\\
\item [3] When moving environments from an existing smart home, compatibility issues arise due to differences between the manufacturer's starting smart device and the target smart device, which makes it difficult for users to move their current convenient smart home settings to a new location. In this situation, there is a need for services and capabilities to easily transfer and set the environment beyond the manufacturer's constraints between the starting and target smart devices.
\\
\item [4] When you move away from the existing place where your smart home is configured and move to another place, the new configuration feels cumbersome. This increases the need for solutions that make it easier to move around and to facilitate the smooth transfer of smart home devices.
\\
\item [5] There are no applications to date that take into account the possibility of automatic replacement for devices that are not in a new location when you move your smart home environment to another location. This is where users experience inconvenience in relocating their environment, and there is a growing demand for new solutions and capabilities.
\\\item [6] Traditional voice notification services often tend to provide information in a way that lists hard and unnecessary content, making it difficult for users to effectively accept information and understand the situation. These limitations increase the need for improved user experience and more effective voice notification services.

\\
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
\item [1] Virtual space\\
1) Basic Assumption: Save the configuration settings and routines I'm currently using to `virtual space.’\\\\
2) If IoT devices set at home are set in a `virtual space’ called ``My House'', the setting of a `virtual space’ called ``My House'' can be imported into another space.
\\
\item [2] Logical hub\\
Backbone SW that gives arbitrary IoT devices the ability to act as a matter hub.
\\
\item [3] synchronization\\
It refers to the process of calling the settings of `virtual space' by scanning a QR code.
\\
\item [4] allocation\\
The function of connecting the IoT devices present in each room to their respective rooms within the hotel.
\\
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scenario}
\begin{itemize}
\item [1)] A hotel entered into an agreement with HOLME and `allocated’ the existing IoT devices to their respective rooms.
\\
\item [2)] User (Customer) uses the HOLME app at home and villa to store and use smart home environments and routines in the form of each `virtual space.’
\\
\item [3)] The user has a business trip coming up, so he browsed a hotel reservation app and made a reservation at a hotel with the HOLME mark.
\\
\item [4)] When the user arrived at the hotel room, he scanned the QR code in the room, thereby `synchronization' that room with the user's `virtual space.’ During the 'sync' process, the user can choose which `virtual space' to `synchronization' with.
\\
\item [5)]Then, a new `virtual space’ that can manage the hotel room was copied into the HOLME app, and the existing settings were applied.
\\
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Profit Structure}
\begin{itemize}
\item [1] Certification and Hotel Partnership\\
HOLME can partner with the hotel to provide certification for the hotel's smart home environment. This certification is responsible for ensuring the quality and stability of the hotel's smart home service to the customer. The hotel may pay a fee to obtain and maintain this certification.
\\
\item [2] Marketing and Public relations agreements\\
Once the hotel is certified by HOLME, it can be used for marketing and promotion purposes.HOLME promotes the hotel in its own application, and the hotel can promote HOLME to mutual benefit.
\\
\item [3] Custom Solutions and Consulting\\
Providing customized smart home solutions for properties such as hotels, and providing consulting and integrated services for this purpose can generate revenue.
\\
\end{itemize}



\section{REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS}

\subsection{Common Features}
\begin{enumerate}


\item[1] Tutorial \\ 
The tutorial should be the first screens where HOLME is downloaded and shown. Users should be able to select the following options. 
\begin{itemize}
\item [1)] Skip the tutorial and sign up directly
\item [2)] View next page. If a user has reached the last page of the tutorial, the next step should be sign-up\\
\end{itemize}


\item[2] Sign-Up \\ 
HOLME needs four types of information to sign up for membership. These are phone numbers, passwords, name, and birth dates.
\begin{itemize}
\item [1)] Enter phone numbers\\
The phone number must be entered, and the phone number is verified through the carrier's authentication system to confirm whether the phone number is valid for membership registration. The phone number serves as an ID in the subsequent login process.
\item [2)] Enter passwords \\
Passwords must be entered and must be at least 8 characters long in combination of 3 or more of English uppercase/English lowercase/number/special characters. When the user enters the desired password, it is displayed in the form of ‘****’ on the screen, expressing information about it as [Unavailable/Safe/Dangerous].
\item [3)] Enter a name  \\
The name must be entered, and subsequently set to the default nickname at first login. The name is also used in ID search.
\item [4)] Enter birth dates \\
The birth dates must be entered, and a pop-up window is displayed every year to celebrate the birthday of the user. The date of birth is also used in ID search.\\
\end{itemize}


\item[3] Log in\\
There are two types of logins: 1) Local logins through HOLME membership, 2) SNS logins through SNS linkage.
\begin{itemize}
\item [1)] Local logins through HOLME membership
\begin{itemize}
\item [(1)] Local logins through HOLME membership
The system checks whether the ID and password entered by the user have filled the digits. If the number of digits is not filled, a warning message is shown in red.
\item [(2)] When the ID and password input by the user exist in the member database, the user succeeds in logging in. After that, it moves to the main page.
\item [(3)] If the phone number and password entered by the user do not exist in the member database, the user fails to log in and displays ``Non-existent member'' in the pop-up window.
\end{itemize}
\item [2)] SNS logins through SNS linkage 
\begin{itemize}
\item [(1)] Utilizes the Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Naver, Kakao sign-up APIs.
\item [(2)] If the SNS login link is successful, the system must receive the user's name and date of birth. Then, go to the main page.\\
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\item[4] Find ID\\
It is a function that exists for people who have lost their ID. HOLME's ID is based on the phone number, but you can add an email. Therefore, when you forget your phone number, you find your phone number using e-mail, and when you forget your e-mail, you find an e-mail based on the phone number. In case you don't remember both, you can find your ID by the name and date of birth registered at the time of membership registration.
\begin{itemize}
\item [1)]  The system receives an e-mail or telephone number. If the corresponding information exists in the user DB, a phone number or email is notified based on the corresponding information.
\item [2)] If the user does not know either e-mail or phone number, the system receives the name and date of birth and teaches the ID if the information exists in the user DB\\
\end{itemize}


\item[5] Resetting password
\begin{itemize}
\item [1)]  The system receives an ID to reset the password.
\item [2)] If the input ID does not exist in the user DB, a warning message will be displayed saying, ``Please enter your email or phone number correctly.''
\item [3)] When the input ID exists in the user DB, the system receives the user's name, date of birth, and phone number, and goes through the process of verifying whether the user is correct through authentication by the carrier.
\item [4)] When the user succeeds in identifying himself/herself, the system receives a password so that the user can reset the password. At this time, the password must have a length of at least 8 characters in a combination of at least three of the English uppercase/English lowercase/number/special characters. When the user enters the desired password, it is displayed in the form of ‘****’ on the screen, expressing information about it as [unavailable/safe/dangerous].\\
\end{itemize}

\item[6] Language change\\
This is a function that should be presented in the upper right corner of the login window, and the initial default value is Korean. You should be able to change this into another language.

\end{figure}
\vspace{1cm}
HOLME users should be able to interact with HOLME's backend using either the frontend or NUGU. To achieve this, we have 4 modules: Frontend, Backend, Instances, and NUGU Playbuilder. 

The first module is the ``Frontend."  We designed the HOLME application using React Native to enable users to directly interact with the app. Users can recognize QR codes on the main page, manipulate devices/routines, and customize various settings according to their preferences.

The second module is the ``Backend."  We utilized Spring Boot to build the application server, with Hibernate serving as the connected database. The backend performs tasks requested by users. Our application includes functions such as user registration/login, space configuration, QR code recognition, device control, and routine execution. The database contains tables for instance configuration, users, and reports. When information is received from users, the server stores it in the database.

The third module is the ``Instances." During the progress of our project, we faced challenges in finding devices that actively support the MATTER protocol. As a solution, we created virtual instances of IoT devices. These instances play the role of devices supporting the MATTER protocol. Additionally, we established a hub in this module to connect these virtual instances to our application.

The fourth module is ``NUGU Playbuilder." This service, provided by SKT, allows developers to create services interacting with NUGU. NUGU plays a role in enabling users to use HOLME through voice commands. Users can manipulate HOLME's main features through NUGU. To facilitate communication between NUGU Playbuilder and the backend, we added a gateway structure built with Flask.\\

HOLME consists of five GitHub repositories: FE\_APP, BE\_SERV, MATTER\_INS, NUGU, and DOC.\\
The FE\_APP repository is used for developing the frontend application of the HOLME project. This repository contains code and files responsible for implementing the overall design and functionality required for users to interact with the HOLME application. The primary focus is on enhancing HOLME's user interface and user experience.\\
The BE\_SERV repository is utilized for implementing the backend services of the HOLME project. It contains code and files needed to handle various tasks requested by users of the HOLME application.

\subsection{Module 1: Frontend}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Purpose\\
    To develop HOLME, we utilized React Native. The frontend plays a crucial role in providing an interface to the user. By offering input fields for users to enter information, it establishes a connection between the user and the server. Once this task is completed, the values are transmitted to the backend. Additionally, the frontend retrieves data from the database, transforms it into a format understandable to the user, and then presents it to the user.\\ \\
    \item Functionality\\
Users can create an account by entering their email, password, and ID, or by using social accounts such as KakaoTalk or Google. Additionally, they have the option to add devices through QR code recognition, operate devices, execute routines, and read reports. The frontend communicates with the backend by sending requests to display information obtained from the database.\\ \\

\subsection{Module 2: Backend}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Purpose\\
    The backend is responsible for managing servers and databases. It stores and manages data and processes actions taken by users on the client side of the application. The backend stores data generated as a result of user actions in the frontend's database and fulfills the role of retrieving data needed by the user from the frontend's database. To implement HOLME's backend, we used Spring. For the database, we employed Hibernate, known for its high compatibility with Spring Boot. Utilizing Hibernate, we stored user information necessary for the application's usage, thus constructing the backend server. Snyk is also used to analyze and manage the possible cyber threats, making the spring-boot server more secure. \\ \\
    \item Functionality\\
HOLME's server is responsible for executing tasks requested by users through the frontend or NUGU and storing corresponding values in the database. When users load or save their settings, this information is stored in the database. Additionally, after actions such as device manipulation, routine execution, and device connections, HOLME provides overall services, including generating reports.\\\\
